[Tom's notes](https://nismod.github.io/presentations/oxford-hpc.html) and [SoGE notes](https://intranet.ouce.ox.ac.uk/it/cs/index.html).

1. CiscoAnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
2. Login using SSO credential, e.g., abcd1234@ox.ac.uk
3. `ssh abcd1234@linux.ouce.ox.ac.uk`, type `yes` and enter password
4. MISTRAL folder is located `/ouce-home/projects/mistral`
   
## Linux cluster password
If you need to reset password you can do so [here](https://iaas.ouce.ox.ac.uk/auth/login?domain=it.ouce.ox.ac.uk).
Set up a new password - this will be called your departmental password. Please
make it between 8 and 14 characters long and have it contain at least 1 number
and 1 capital letter. Once it's successful, you should see a green box on top
of the page with a message that the password was changed.
